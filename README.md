# Activity Recognition system based on Multisensor data fusion

ML Algo Used: Logistic Regression

Dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Activity Recognition applications.

The classification tasks consist in predicting the activity performed by the user from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN.

Problem: Predicting the activity of the person ( bending, cycling, lying down, sitting, standing, walking)
